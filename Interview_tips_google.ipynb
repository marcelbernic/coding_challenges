    "Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Interview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Duration: 45mins\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Hangouts call (video is optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding is done on Google Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure you have a working internet connection and current web browser :)\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be about 1-3 different questions (dependent on complexity) related to coding, data structures and algorithms. You will be expected to come up with optimized and production-ready code, free of bugs. You should not write in pseudo-code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Important areas of assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding - Good Code quality (No IDE. Fully functional code. Take care of syntax, good language constructs, clean and concise code) & Coding fast (You can code in Codechef timed challenges to practise coding under time pressure)\n",
    "\n",
    "DS & Algo - Refer to below topics and what we are accessing for\n",
    "\n",
    "Good communication - Talk out loud, explain your thought process to the interviewer\n",
    "\n",
    "Attitude - Being independent, Lead/drive the discussion forward while being receptive to hints from interviewers and integrating it in your solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed of solving the question (Ideally 20mins per question - Refer to being notes on time allocation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 1: Think out Loud & Communicate your Thought Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Google interviewers are accessing you based on your problem solving skills, and want to know your full thought process behind why and how you derived the final result\n",
    "\n",
    "Talk through your entire thought process & explain about your approach, how you derive a certain algorithm, explain the trade offs, and discuss the complexity of the solutions you are proposing and explain your code (Talk and Code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most important would be to pick the right data structure and algorithm for a specific problem! Talk about how they're implemented and why you'd choose one implementation or data structure instead of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not mumble to yourself or keep silent when thinking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 2: Ask Clarifying Questions (Very Important!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Never jump straight and code up the solution. Always take a pause, look at the interview question and ask some clarifying questions\n",
    "\n",
    "These clarifying questions should enable you to cover for edge/boundary cases better and to define the scope of the question\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg:\"Describe a good algorithm for sorting a million numbers\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Clarifying Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the range of the numbers? How are they distributed? Are the numbers integers or floating points?  How much memory is available? Are there duplicates?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 3: Discuss algorithmic complexities & Identify all Edge Cases Independently\n",
    "\n",
    "For Algorithms, you will need to know big-o notation very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always state time and space complexities upfront. Think of how you can reduce the complexity further to reach an optimised solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguish between average case/worst case runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider amortized time complexities!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to reach the most optimised solution at the end of the interview, and to have a complete working solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 4: Test your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Check for boundary conditions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Stress tests to ensure that the code runs within time constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Create tests that have 100% code coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Rectify any bugs in your code before the interviewer points it out\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 5: Ensure Good Code Quality on Google Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to code in Google Docs. Since it does not have any IDE, you are expected to type out your code from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Type as close to fully functional code as possible. This code should be maintainable and readable by a large database of engineers\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code is supposed to be very readable. Code in the latest version of your preferred language and use appropriate language constructs. Take care of variable names and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not code Pseudo code or shortcuts, it is not good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always cover for Edge/Boundary cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 6: Positive & Independent Attitude & Being Open to Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck, stay calm, asking questions can help to reduce the scope of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim to solve as much independently as possible, ideally with as few hints as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always take the initiative in the interview, and treat it like a technical discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Listen attentively to the interviewer, and integrate the hints/suggestions by the interviewer to your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interview Preparation Plan (created by Google Software Engineers)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Revise all concepts on data structures & algorithms (Geekforgeeks) - you can also use this gitHub link on CS fundamentals that can serve as a checklist while preparing. This  BigO cheat sheet <http://bigocheatsheet.com/>  could help you as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structured Revision plan on the topics that to cover (Eg. hashtable, hashmaps, trees, arrays, strings, graphs, dynamic programming and more)\n",
    "\n",
    "Practise per category\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice up to a level that you reach competency - Solve the question in 20 minutes, come up with the optimal solutions, with close to zero hints, no bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Practice Problem Identification by picking random problems and practice identifying “Which category does this problem belong to? Backtracking/Dynamic programming? Solution/Algorithmic design?”.\n",
    "Practice coding without an IDE, be familiar with the differences in how you should write code in Google Docs. Do practise coding in Google Docs within a set time frame and getting comfortable talking while coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advice: Practise a wide variety of questions, and simulate the actual the interview conditions! \n",
    "\n",
    "Time Allocation During Interview (Suggestion from Googlers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve 1 question in 20mins\n",
    "\n",
    "2 mins for gathering all requirements and asking clarifying questions from the interviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approx 8-10 mins for coming up with valid solution to the question, discussion with the interviewer about your solution, trade offs, the time and space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 mins for coding the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 mins for dry run (sample test cases) along with discussion with the interviewer.\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll be expected to know and apply: lists, maps, stacks, priority queues, binary trees, graphs, bags, and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For algorithms you'll want to know greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, recursion, and brute force search.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll definitely want to be conversant with big­O notation, time­-space complexity, and real world performance of all of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are assessing for Data Structures & Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you implement the most optimized data structure and algorithm for the question?\n",
